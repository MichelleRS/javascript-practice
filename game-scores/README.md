# Game Scores

## MVP Goal

Build a form that saves data for game scores. Data schema includes level name and score.

## Status

- _MVP in progress_

## Fixes

- Select options were rendering their index value, not their maze value.

  - Solution: Get array of maze values and use a `for...in` loop to append maze values as options in the select element
